                            Imagine a table, a table full of food. A family sitting around it - imagine as vividly as
                            you can. Probably you can, but is that for everyone? No such table is left in a certain
                            place after one of the most heinous wars mankind has ever seen, after the Second World War.
                            A war so destructive that it has destroyed the prospects of imagining a brighter future. A
                            battle so brutal that love has died, the only form of human emotion that remains is
                            vengeance. Who would have ever imagined such a scenario before? Is hope still a word?

                            No, I am not talking about the Gaza-Israel war that has claimed thousands of Israeli and
                            Palestinian lives. It is the Russo-Ukrainian War that has wreaked the souls of millions
                            across the globe, claiming the lives of people unwilling to fight an unjust war.

                            THE COST OF CONFLICT</h2>

                        <p>
                            The reverberations of this conflict extend far beyond the scorched earth of the frontlines.
                            It is in the empty chairs at dinner tables, the silence where laughter once resided, and the
                            cold realization that history, for all our promises of "never again," has a habit of rhyming
                            in the most tragic of ways.
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                            We are witnessing a dismantling not just of infrastructure, but of the human spirit. The
                            psychological toll of constant bombardment, of displacement, and of the uncertainty of
                            tomorrow creates a scar that no treaty can heal. It forces us to ask uncomfortable questions
                            about the nature of our "civilized" world.

                            Yet, in the midst of this darkness, there is a resilience that defies logic. It is the
                            resilience of those who stay, of those who rebuild, and of those who continue to speak truth
                            to power. Perhaps hope isn't a word we find in the dictionary of peace, but a verb we
                            conjugate in the trenches of survival.
