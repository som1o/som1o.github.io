                Imagine a table, a table full of food. A family sitting around it - imagine as vividly as you can. Probably you can,but is that for everyone? No such table is left in a certain place after one of the most heinous wars mankind has ever seen, after the Second
                World War. A war so destructive that it has destroyed the prospects of imagining a brighter future. A
                battle so brutal that love has died, the only form of human emotion that remains is vengeance. Who would
                have ever imagined such a scenario before? Is hope still a word?
            </p>

            <p>
                No, I am not talking about the Gaza-Israel war that has claimed thousands of Israeli and Palestinian
                lives. It is the Russo-Ukrainian War that has wreaked the souls of millions across the globe, claiming
                the lives of people unwilling to fight an unjust war.

            <h2>The Cost of Conflict</h2>

            <p>
                The reverberations of this conflict extend far beyond the scorched earth of the frontlines. It is in the
                empty chairs at dinner tables, the silence where laughter once resided, and the cold realization that
                history, for all our promises of "never again," has a habit of rhyming in the most tragic of ways.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are witnessing a dismantling not just of infrastructure, but of the human spirit. The psychological
                toll of constant bombardment, of displacement, and of the uncertainty of tomorrow creates a scar that no
                treaty can heal. It forces us to ask uncomfortable questions about the nature of our "civilized" world.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "War does not determine who is right - only who is left." - Bertrand Russell
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Yet, in the midst of this darkness, there is a resilience that defies logic. It is the resilience of
                those who stay, of those who rebuild, and of those who continue to speak truth to power. Perhaps hope
                isn't a word we find in the dictionary of peace, but a verb we conjugate in the trenches of survival.
