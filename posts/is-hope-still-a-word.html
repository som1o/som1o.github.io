                        Imagine a table, a table full of food. A family sitting around it — imagine as vividly as
                        you can. Probably you can, but is that for everyone? No such table is left in a certain
                        place after one of the most heinous wars mankind has ever seen, after the Second World War.
                        A war so destructive that it has destroyed the prospects of imagining a brighter future. A
                        battle so brutal that love has died, the only form of human emotion that remains is
                        vengeance. Who would have ever imagined such a scenario before? Is hope still a word?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        No, I am not talking about the Gaza-Israel war that has claimed thousands of Israeli and
                        Palestinian lives. It is the Russo-Ukrainian War that has wreaked the souls of millions
                        across the globe, claiming the lives of people unwilling to fight an unjust war.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Roots of Escalation</h2>

                    <p>
                        To understand the full weight of this conflict, we must first trace its roots back beyond
                        February 2022. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left behind a geopolitical vacuum
                        that both NATO and Russia rushed to fill. Ukraine, the largest country entirely within Europe by
                        area, found itself caught between two gravitational fields: the promise of Western integration
                        and the inescapable pull of its historical ties to Moscow.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        NATO's eastward expansion — absorbing Poland in 1999, the Baltic states in 2004, and the ongoing
                        courtship of Georgia and Ukraine — was perceived by Moscow not as a defensive measure, but as an
                        existential encirclement. Whether one agrees with that characterization or not, the perception
                        itself became a geopolitical fact. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was, in many ways, the
                        opening act of a drama whose climax arrived eight years later with the full-scale invasion.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Cost of Conflict</h2>

                    <p>
                        The reverberations of this conflict extend far beyond the scorched earth of the frontlines.
                        It is in the empty chairs at dinner tables, the silence where laughter once resided, and the
                        cold realization that history, for all our promises of "never again," has a habit of rhyming
                        in the most tragic of ways.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The numbers alone are staggering. By conservative estimates, hundreds of thousands of soldiers
                        and civilians have been killed or wounded on both sides. Over six million Ukrainians were
                        displaced internally, while another eight million fled to neighboring countries — creating the
                        largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Entire cities like Mariupol, Bakhmut, and
                        Avdiivka have been reduced to skeletal ruins, their names now synonymous with destruction rather
                        than the communities they once housed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are witnessing a dismantling not just of infrastructure, but of the human spirit. The
                        psychological toll of constant bombardment, of displacement, and of the uncertainty of
                        tomorrow creates a scar that no treaty can heal. It forces us to ask uncomfortable questions
                        about the nature of our "civilized" world.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Energy as a Weapon</h2>

                    <p>
                        One of the most consequential dimensions of this war has been the weaponization of energy.
                        Russia's position as Europe's primary natural gas supplier gave it immense leverage — a
                        strategic card that was played with ruthless precision. The Nord Stream pipelines, once symbols
                        of European-Russian economic interdependence, became instruments of coercion. When gas flows
                        were reduced and eventually halted, the resulting energy crisis sent shockwaves through European
                        economies, driving up inflation, straining social safety nets, and forcing a fundamental
                        rethinking of energy policy across the continent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022 — an act of sabotage whose
                        perpetrators remain officially unidentified — represented something unprecedented: the
                        deliberate destruction of critical civilian infrastructure connecting sovereign nations. It was
                        a signal that the rules of engagement in modern conflict have expanded beyond anything
                        previously codified in international law.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For developing nations like Bangladesh, these energy disruptions were not abstract geopolitical
                        chess moves. They translated directly into higher fuel prices, more expensive fertilizers, and
                        increased food insecurity — a brutal reminder that in a globalized world, no nation is truly
                        insulated from distant conflicts.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Information Battlefield</h2>

                    <p>
                        This is also the first major war fought simultaneously on the physical and digital fronts.
                        Social media has become both a tool of resistance and a vector for disinformation. Ukrainian
                        President Zelenskyy's nightly video addresses, filmed in the khaki uniform of a wartime leader,
                        turned the smartphone into a weapon of morale. Conversely, Russian state media's carefully
                        constructed narratives of "denazification" and "special military operations" demonstrated how
                        language itself can be conscripted into service.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For a student of statistics, the information war presents a fascinating — and deeply troubling —
                        case study. How do you verify casualty figures when both sides have incentives to inflate or
                        deflate? How do you parse satellite imagery when even raw data can be selectively presented? The
                        fog of war has become a fog of data, and the tools of statistical analysis — meant to illuminate
                        truth — are being tested as never before.
                    </p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Geometry of Hope</h2>

                    <p>
                        Yet, in the midst of this darkness, there is a resilience that defies logic. It is the
                        resilience of those who stay, of those who rebuild, and of those who continue to speak truth
                        to power. Ukrainian farmers towing Russian tanks with tractors. Volunteers forming human chains
                        to deliver supplies. Teachers conducting classes in underground metro stations while missiles
                        fall overhead. These are not merely anecdotes — they are data points in the most important
                        dataset of all: the measurement of human resolve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Perhaps hope isn't a word we find in the dictionary of peace, but a verb we
                        conjugate in the trenches of survival. It is not the absence of despair, but the decision to act
                        despite it. Hope, in its truest statistical sense, is the residual — what remains after you
                        subtract everything that should have destroyed it. And in that residual, perhaps, lies the most
                        important variable of all.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I do not know when this war will end, or what borders the map will show when it does. But I
                        believe that the people who have endured it — the families scattered across Europe, the soldiers
                        in trenches they never asked to dig, the children who have known nothing but the sound of sirens
                        — deserve more than our attention. They deserve our rigorous analysis, our honest accounting,
                        and our refusal to look away.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Is hope still a word? I think it has to be. Not because the evidence supports optimism, but
                        because the alternative — a world without it — is the one scenario no model can survive.
                    </p>
