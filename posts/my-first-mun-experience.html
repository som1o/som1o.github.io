                        So, I finally did it. I walked into a room full of people in suits, all pretending to be
                        diplomats of
                        countries they've probably never visited, ready to travel through the web of Digital
                        Governance and State Sovereignty for two days. Yes, my first Model
                        United Nations (MUN) at DU Diplomatic Conclave 2026 by DUMUNA where I represented Nigeria in
                        UNHRC.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Honestly, I was mentally prepared but inexperienced. The placards, the formal language ("The
                        delegate of Nigeria wishes to
                        yield..."), the sheer intensity of it all. It felt like stepping onto a stage without a
                        script. But
                        then, the debate started.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Chaos and Coffee</h2>

                    <p>
                        The first day was a blur of speeches and moderated caucuses (which is basically just fancy
                        organized
                        chaos). I remember frantically scribbling notes, trying to form an alliance with the
                        delegate of China
                        while avoiding the glare of the delegate of US. We were discussing the issue of the digital
                        divide, state sovereignty, and the right to privacy in the digital age.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But here's the thing: somewhere between the drafting of the committee paper and the 2 PM
                        ad-hoc committee updates, I
                        realized that this wasn't just roleplay. It was a crash course in ready wit and quick
                        thinking. You have to step out of your
                        own shoes and argue for a perspective that might be completely alien to you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I didn't win Best Delegate, but won a special mention award. And I walked out of that
                        conference with a newfound respect for the complexity of the world and a little more
                        confidence in my own
                        voice. And really, isn't that the point?
                    </p>
