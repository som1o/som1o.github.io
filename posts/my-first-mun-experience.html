                So, I finally did it. I walked into a room full of people in suits, all pretending to be diplomats of
                countries they’ve probably never visited, ready to travel through the web of Digital Governance and State Sovereignty for two days. Yes, my first Model
                United Nations (MUN) at DU Diplomatic Conclave 2026 by DUMUNA where I represented Nigeria in UNHRC.
            </p>

            <p>
                Honestly, I was mentally prepared but inexperienced. The placards, the formal language ("The delegate of Nigeria wishes to
                yield..."), the sheer intensity of it all. It felt like stepping onto a stage without a script. But
                then, the debate started.
            </p>

            <h2>Chaos and Coffee</h2>

            <p>
                The first day was a blur of speeches and moderated caucuses (which is basically just fancy organized
                chaos). I remember frantically scribbling notes, trying to form an alliance with the delegate of China
                while avoiding the glare of the delegate of US. We were discussing the issue of the digital divide, state sovereignty, and the right to privacy in the digital age.
            </p>

            <p>
                But here's the thing: somewhere between the drafting of the committee paper and the 2 PM ad-hoc committee updates, I
                realized that this wasn't just roleplay. It was a crash course in ready wit and quick thinking. You have to step out of your
                own shoes and argue for a perspective that might be completely alien to you.
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn't win Best Delegate, but won a special mention award. And I walked out of that conference with a newfound respect for the complexity of the world and a little more confidence in my own
                voice. And really, isn't that the point?
